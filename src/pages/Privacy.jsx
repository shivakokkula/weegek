      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Weegek is committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data transparently and securely. This policy outlines how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use our website, products, and services.</p>

This policy also explains your choices surrounding how we use your personal information, which include how you can object to certain uses of the information and how you can access and update certain information.</p>

      <h3>What information we collect</h3>
      <p>We collect data to enable us to operate our Services and provide you with the best experiences on our website and using our Services.

      <h4>Cookies and similar technologies information</h4>

Please see here for more information about our use of cookies and similar technologies.</p>

      <h4>Information from other sources</h4>

      <p>When you grant us authorization to connect to another service provider, such as Google, we collect data from that tool per the permission scopes requested from you.

      <p>We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation. If you choose to store any sensitive personal information on our servers, you are responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data.</p>

      <h4>      If you are a child under the age of 16, you may not use our Services. Software does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 16. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a User who is under the age of 16, we will have to terminate your use of our Services.

      </ul>
<h4>How we share the information we collect</h4>
We may share your personal information with third parties under one of the following circumstances:

<h4>With your consent</h4>

We share your personal information, if you consent, after letting you know what information will be shared, with whom, and why.

<h4>With service providers</h4>

We share personal information with a limited number of service providers who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our Service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to the ones in our Privacy Statement by signing data protection agreements or making similar commitments. Our service providers perform analytics, payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, and other similar services. While Software processes all personal information in the United States, our service providers may process data outside of the United States or the European Union.

<h4>Sharing content with others</h4>

Software may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools, which let you share actions you take on Software with other media, such as Twitter, and vice versa. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature.

<h4>Advertising partners</h4>

We do not use or share your information, including personal information, to advertise any third party’s products or services via the Services. We may use and share your personal information with third-party advertising partners to market our own Services and grow our Services’ user base, such as to provide targeted marketing about our own Services via third-party services.

<h4>For security purposes</h4>

If you are a member of a Software team or organization, Software may share your username, Usage Information, and Device Information associated with that team or organization, to the extent that such information is required.

<h4>For legal disclosure</h4>

Software strives for transparency in complying with legal process and legal obligations. Unless prevented from doing so by law or court order, or in rare, exigent circumstances, we make a reasonable effort to notify users of any legally compelled or required disclosure of their information. Software may disclose information we collect about you to law enforcement if required in response to a valid subpoena, court order, search warrant, a similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.

<h4>Disclosures to protect us or others</h4>

We may access, preserve, and disclose any information we store in association with you to external parties if we, in good faith, believe doing so is required or appropriate to: (i) comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (ii) protect your, our, or others’ rights, property, or safety; (iii) enforce our policies or contracts; (iv) collect amounts owed to us; or (v) assist with an investigation and prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity.

<h4>Disclosure in the event of merger, sale, or other asset transfer:</h4>

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, purchase or sale of assets, or transition of service to another provider, then your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction, as permitted by law and/or contract.

We do not sell your personal information for monetary or other consideration. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) requires businesses to state in their privacy policy whether or not they disclose personal information in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration. While CCPA only covers California residents, when it goes into effect we will voluntarily extend its core rights for people to control their data to all of our users, not just those who live in California.

<h4>How we secure your information</h4>
Software takes commercially reasonable steps designed to protect personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of personal information.

We hash sensitive information, such as project and file names, at the time of collection in our plugin. We use the Blake2b hashing algorithm to ensure the security of your data. Transmission of data on Software is encrypted using SSH and HTTPS (TLS). Our data remains hashed when it is stored.

No method of transmission, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.  Please keep this in mind when disclosing any personal information to us over the Internet. In addition, we are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Services, or third party websites.

<h4>How you can access and control the information we collect</h4>
If you're already a Software user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by editing your user profile. You can control the information we collect about you by limiting what information you provide in your profile.

<h4>Data access</h4>

Under The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), you have the right to access your data. You can request a copy of your data in your account settings.

<h4>Data retention</h4>

We store the personal information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.

<h4>Deletion of data</h4>

If you would like to cancel your account or delete your personal information, you may do so in your account settings. Barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile (within reason). You may contact us to request the erasure of the data we process on the basis of consent within 30 days. After an account has been deleted, certain non-identifiable data may remain. However, we will delete or de-identify your personal information, including your username and email address.

<h4>Anonymized data</h4>

Your data is anonymized before it is aggregated as part of a reference class, such as a team or global reference class. This information is not personally identifiable. If you are using our Services, such as our Code Time plugin, without registering for a Software web account, your information will be anonymous. We also do not consider this data personal information.
