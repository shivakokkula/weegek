      <h3>3. Account Terms</h3>
      <h4>3.1 Access to Services</h4>
      <p>
        Software distributes the Service online. You are solely responsible for
        providing, installing, and maintaining at your own expense all
        equipment, facilities, and services necessary to enable Authorized
        Users' access and use of the Service through the interface, including,
        without limitation all computer hardware, software, and Internet access.
      </p>

      <h4>3.2 User Account Security</h4>
      <p>
        You are solely responsible for tracking and for ensuring the security
        and confidentiality of all user identifiers and passwords. Software has
        no liability with respect to any use or misuse of such identifiers or
        passwords, and any use other than as provided in this Agreement will be
        considered a breach of this Agreement by you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Software has implemented commercially reasonable, industry-standard
        technical and organizational measures designed to secure your data from
        accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or
        disclosure. Each hosting provider for the Service has or will have
        similar contractual obligations to Software. Software does not represent
        that it meets the standards for operational compliance or certification
        in any specific area, including any government or industry-association
        requirements (see Section 15.3).
      </p>

      <h3>4. Acceptable Use</h3>
      <h4>4.1 Compliance with Laws and Regulations</h4>
      <p>
        You will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure, through proper
        instructions and enforcement actions, that all access to and use of the
        Service by you or Authorized Users, or otherwise through your
        facilities, equipment, identifiers, or passwords, will conform to this
        Agreement and will be made and used solely for proper and legal
        purposes, and will be conducted in a manner that does not violate any
        law or regulation, the rights of any third party, or this Agreement.
      </p>

      <h4>4.2 Conduct Restrictions</h4>
      <ul>

        </li>
        <li>
          Access the Service in order to build a competitive solution or to
          assist any third party to build a competitive solution

      <p>
        In the event you violate any of the terms in this section, in addition
        to any other remedies available at law or in equity, Software will have

        Users' use and access to the Service.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Service Period</h3>
      <p>
        This Agreement will commence on the Subscription Date and, unless
        terminated early in accordance with Section 7, continue for the number
        of months or year(s) specified in the Subscription as measured from the
        Subscription Date (the "Initial Period").
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are using a Paying Plan, this Agreement will automatically renew
        for successive renewal periods of the same duration of the Initial
        Period (each, a "Renewal Period") unless one party gives notice of
        termination or non-renewal. The Initial Period and all subsequent
        Renewal Periods are collectively the "Service Period."
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are using the Service under a Free Plan, this Agreement will be
        deemed month-to-month and either party will be free to not renew, or to
        terminate, this Agreement immediately upon notice to the other.

        rights under this Agreement or any other agreement between the parties
      </p>
      <p>
        Any use or disclosure required by applicable law, provided that the
        Recipient uses reasonable efforts to give the Discloser reasonable
        advance notice to afford the Discloser an opportunity to intervene and

        Confidential Information
      </p>
      <p>Any use or disclosure made with the consent of the Discloser.</p>
      <p>
        In the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Recipient of its
        obligations under this section, the Discloser will be entitled to
        injunctive and other equitable relief to enforce such obligations. The
        obligations of confidentiality will survive expiration or termination of
        this Agreement.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Pre-Release Program</h3>
      <p>
        As set forth in the Non-Disclosure Agreement, you agree that you will
        not disclose, publish, or otherwise disseminate any Confidential
        Information to anyone other than individuals who are employees of
        Software, members of the pre-release program, or as otherwise expressly
        permitted or agreed to in writing by Software. You further agree to take

        subject only to the limited rights expressly granted in this Agreement
        and intellectual property rights. You are solely responsible, and

        functionality, graphics, techniques, methods, applications, computer
        programs, libraries, user manuals, documentation, products or other
        technology and materials of any kind, or any enhancement thereto, used
        by Software in connection with the performance of the Service or the
        Support, or made available by Software to you, any Authorized User, or
        any third party in connection with the Service or the Support. Without

      </p>

      <p>
        The Service and Technology constitute or otherwise involve valuable
        intellectual property rights of Software, and Software will own all
        right, title, and interest in and to the above. No title to or ownership
        of the Service or Technology, or any intellectual property rights
        associated therewith, is transferred to you, any Authorized User, or any
        third party under this Agreement. Sections 8-9 describe the entirety of
        your limited rights to access and use the Service and Agents and to make
        the Service and Agents available to Authorized Users. Except with
        respect to certain of the Agents, in no event will you be entitled to
        access or review any object code or source code. Software reserves all
        rights to the Service and Technology not otherwise expressly granted
        herein.
      </p>

      <h3>13. Limitations of Liability</h3>
      <p>
        You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third
        party for any damage, injury, or loss of profits, use, goodwill, or
        data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential, or
        exemplary damages, however arising, that result from:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The use, disclosure, or display of your Customer Data</li>
        <li>Your use or inability to use the Service</li>
        <li>
          Any modification, price change, suspension, interruption, cessation of
          transmission, or discontinuance of the Service
        </li>
        <li>
          The Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service
          available
        </li>
        <li>
          Unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data
        </li>
        <li>Statements or conduct of any third party on the Service</li>
        <li>
          Any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use
          of the Service
        </li>
        <li>
          {" "}
          Hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access or use of the Service
          or your account(s) or the information contained therein
        </li>
        <li>Errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of data</li>
        <li>
          Personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever,
          resulting from your and authorized users' access to and use of the
          Service or support
        </li>
        <li>Any other matter relating to the Service.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the
        possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy described in this
        Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have
        no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our
        reasonable control.
      </p>

      <p>
        These limitations will not apply to damages arising out of a party's
        failure to comply with its confidentiality obligations, indemnification
        obligations, or payment obligations to Software. Except for their
        respective indemnity and confidentiality obligations, in no event will
        either party, their affiliates, directors, employees, or licensors be
        liable to the other party or any authorized user for any claims,
        proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses, or costs in an
        amount exceeding the fees you paid to Software.
      </p>

      <p>
        This limitation of liability section applies whether the alleged
        liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or
        any other basis, even if the non-breaching party has been advised of the
        possibility of such damage. The above limitations of liability will
        apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable
        jurisdiction.
      </p>
